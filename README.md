# Learning Journey of C language

This repository contains small example programs grouped into steps (Step-1 through Step-4) used for learning C programming. It contains source files (`*.c`) demonstrating basic concepts and simple console programs.

Notes:
- I added a `.gitignore` to stop tracking compiled binaries and IDE settings.
- If you want compiled binaries removed from the repository history entirely, tell me and I can guide you through a rewrite (this is more advanced).

Structure:
- `Step-1 - Babylaying/` — beginner examples
- `Step-2 - Babysitting/` — simple control flow and operators
- `Step-3 - Babycrawling/` — intermediate problems (loops, functions)
- `Step-4 - Babystanding/` — pattern printing and practice problems

Happy learning! If you'd like, I can also add build instructions or split the repo into smaller projects.
